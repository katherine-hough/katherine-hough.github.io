    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <p>
    As technical computing software, such as MATLAB and SciPy, has gained popularity, ecosystems of interdependent software
    solutions and communities have formed around these technologies.
    The development and maintenance of these technical computing ecosystems requires expertise in both software engineering
    and the underlying technical domain. The inherently
    interdisciplinary nature of these ecosystems presents unique challenges and opportunities that shape software
    development practices.
    Proof assistants, a type of technical computing software, aid users in the creation of formal proofs. In order to
    examine the influence of the underlying technical domain&em;mathematics&em;on the development of proof assistant
    ecosystems, we mined participant activity data from the code repositories and social channels of three popular proof
    assistants: Lean, Coq, Isabelle. Despite having a shared technical domain, we found little cross-pollination between
    contributors to the proof assistants. Additionally, we found that most long-term developers focused solely on technical
    work and did not participate in official social channels. We also found that proof assistant developers specialized into
    technical subfields. However, the proportion of specialists varied between ecosystems. We did not find evidence that
    these specialties contributed to fractures within the ecosystems. We discuss the implications of these results on the
    long-term health and sustainability of proof assistant ecosystems.
