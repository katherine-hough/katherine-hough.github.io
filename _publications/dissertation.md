    <p>
        Software testing supports the production of reliable, high-quality software by facilitating the identification
        and correction of defects. However, writing effective tests and debugging detected failures requires
        substantial developer effort and expertise. This dissertation explores the use of dynamic data relationships,
        associations between values in a program at runtime, to enable developers to test and debug their systems
        more thoroughly with less effort and expertise. We present the following contributions: 1) an approach
        for using taint tracking to enable existing tests to detect additional classes of defects, 2) an alternative
        approach for propagating control-flow relationships in taint tracking that can be used to aid in developers’
        understanding of failures exposed by tests, 3) an approach for using relationships between values to enable
        parametric fuzzers to more thoroughly exercise system behaviors, and 4) an approach for automatically
        tracking information flows in modern Java Virtual Machines.
